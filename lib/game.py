        INSTRUCTIONS: 
        The objective is to defeat all five enemies plus one boss enemy.
        Your hero has Health Points (HP) that diminish when receiving attacks.
        Your HP will be displayed after the start of your adventure and before every fight.
        You will be asked to fight or flee before every fight, excluding the boss fight.
        Fighting will commence the fight between you and the enemy.
        Attacks will be entered with "Hit/hit" and will do random damage to an enemy.
        Fleeing will cause you to avoid the fight at the cost of 7 HP.
        VICTORY if you defeat all five enemies and the boss.
        DEFEAT if you lose all of your HP.
