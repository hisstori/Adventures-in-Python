        || The objective is to defeat all five enemies plus one boss enemy.                    ||
        || Your hero has Health Points (HP) that diminish when receiving attacks.              ||
        || Your HP will be displayed after the start of your adventure and before every fight. ||
        || You will be asked to fight or flee before every fight, excluding the boss fight.    ||
        || Fighting will commence the fight between you and the enemy.                         ||
        || Attacks will be entered with "Hit/hit" and will do random damage to an enemy.       ||
        || Fleeing will cause you to avoid the fight at the cost of 7 HP.                      ||
        || VICTORY: You defeat all five enemies and the boss.                                ||
        || DEFEAT: You lose all of your HP.                                                  ||
